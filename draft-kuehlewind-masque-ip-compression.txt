1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an extension for IP header compression when
   using Connect-IP [CONNECT-IP] proxying.  It specifies a way to
   indicate which IP header fields can be omitted and provides reference
   values that are then used to reconstruct omitted fields when using
   the indicated context ID.

   This document defines four new capsules to assign new context IDs and
   provide static information in IPv4 and IPv6 headers, acknowlegde the
   use of such a context ID, or cancel its use.  The capsules MUST only
   be used with Connect-IP [CONNECT-IP].

   Extending this work to include compression of transport layer fields
   like the port numbers in TCP or UDP is left for consideration for
   further revisions.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN and IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsules

   The IPv4 Compression Assign capsule (capsule type TBD) is used to
   register a Context ID and provides reference values of the IP header
   fields that will be omitted from the HTTP Datagram Payload when using
   this Context ID.  It has the following format:

   IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN Capsule {
     Type (i) = TBD,
     Length (i),
     Context ID (i),
     IPv4 Flags (16),
     IPv4 Header (20)
   }

              Figure 1: IPv4 Compression Assign Capsule Format

   It contains the following fields:

   IPv4 Flags:  A 16-bit field containing flags that indicate which
      byte-aligned IP header fields can be omitted.  The format is
      defined in Figure 2.

   IPv4 Header:  This field contains the first 20 bytes of the IPv4
      header.  Fields that are not indicated as omitted will be included
      in the compressed packet and therefore their reference value is
      not relevant.

   The IPv4 Flags field has the following format:

   IPv4 Flags {
     Version-IHL (1),
     DSCP-ECN (1),
     Total Length (1),
     Identification (1),
     Flags-FragOffset (1),
     TTL (1),
     Protocol (1),
     Checksum (1),
     Source Address (1),
     Destination Address (1),
     Reserved (6),
   }

                        Figure 2: IPv4 Flags Format

   The flags have the following meanings:

   Version-IHL:  This flag indicates if byte 0 of the IPv4 header
      (Version and IHL fields) can be omitted.

   DSCP-ECN:  This flag indicates if byte 1 of the IPv4 header (DSCP and
      ECN fields) can be omitted.

   Total Length:  This flag indicates if bytes 2-3 of the IPv4 header
      (Total Length field) can be omitted (receiver will compute from
      payload size).

   Identification:  This flag indicates if bytes 4-5 of the IPv4 header
      (Identification field) can be omitted.

   Flags-FragOffset:  This flag indicates if bytes 6-7 of the IPv4
      header (Flags and Fragment Offset fields) can be omitted.

   TTL:  This flag indicates if byte 8 of the IPv4 header (TTL field)
      can be omitted.

   Protocol:  This flag indicates if byte 9 of the IPv4 header (Protocol
      field) can be omitted.

   Checksum:  This flag indicates if bytes 10-11 of the IPv4 header
      (Header Checksum field) can be omitted (receiver will recompute).

   Source Address:  This flag indicates if bytes 12-15 of the IPv4
      header (Source Address field) can be omitted.

   Destination Address:  This flag indicates if bytes 16-19 of the IPv4
      header (Destination Address field) can be omitted.

   Reserved:  These bits are reserved for future use and MUST be set to
      zero.

   IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN Capsule {
     Type (i) = TBD,
     Length (i),
     Context ID (i),
     IPv6 Flags (16),
     IPv6 Header (40)
   }

              Figure 3: IPv6 Compression Assign Capsule Format

   It contains the following fields:

   IPv6 Flags:  A 16-bit field containing flags that indicate which
      byte-aligned IP header fields can be omitted.  The format is
      defined in Figure 4.

   IPv6 Header:  This field contains the first 40 bytes of the IPv6
      header.  Fields that are not indicated as omitted will be included
      in the compressed packet and therefore their reference value is
      not relevant.

   The IPv6 Flags field has the following format:

   IPv6 Flags {
     Version-FL (1),
     Traffic Class (1),
     Payload Length (1),
     Next Header (1),
     Hop Limit (1),
     Source Address (1),
     Destination Address (1),
     Reserved (9),
   }

                        Figure 4: IPv6 Flags Format

   The flags have the following meanings:

   Version-FL:  This flag indicates if the Version field (upper 4 bits
      of byte 0) and Flow Label field (lower 4 bits of byte 1, and all
      of bytes 2-3) can be omitted.  When this flag is set but the
      Traffic Class flag is not set, the Traffic Class field (lower 4
      bits of byte 0 and upper 4 bits of byte 1) MUST be preserved as a
      single byte in the compressed packet.

   Traffic Class:  This flag indicates if the Traffic Class field (lower
      4 bits of byte 0 and upper 4 bits of byte 1) can be omitted.  This
      flag can be set independently of the Version-FL flag to allow
      omitting Version and Flow Label while preserving Traffic Class.

   Payload Length:  This flag indicates if bytes 4-5 of the IPv6 header
      (Payload Length field) can be omitted (receiver will compute from
      payload size).

   Next Header:  This flag indicates if byte 6 of the IPv6 header (Next
      Header field) can be omitted.

   Hop Limit:  This flag indicates if byte 7 of the IPv6 header (Hop
      Limit field) can be omitted.

   Source Address:  This flag indicates if bytes 8-23 of the IPv6 header
      (Source Address field) can be omitted.

   Destination Address:  This flag indicates if bytes 24-39 of the IPv6
      header (Destination Address field) can be omitted.

   Reserved:  These bits are reserved for future use and MUST be set to
      zero.

   When the indicated Context ID is used, all IP header fields that are
   flagged as omitted as well as the version field MUST be omitted from
   the HTTP datagram payload.  The receiver of the datagram with the
   indicated Context ID MUST reconstruct the complete IP header using
   the reference values from the COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule and/or by
   computing derived values (such as checksums and length fields) before
   forwarding the payload.

   When an endpoint receives a IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or
   IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule, it MUST either accept or reject the
   corresponding registration:

   *  if it accepts the registration, the receiver MUST return a
      COMPRESSION_ACK capsule with the Context ID set to the one from
      the received IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN
      capsule back to its peer

   *  if it rejects the registration, the receiver MUST respond by
      sending a COMPRESSION_CLOSE capsule with the Context ID set to the
      one from the received IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or
      IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule.

   As mandated in Section 4 of [CONNECT-UDP], clients can only allocate
   even Context IDs, while proxies can only allocate odd ones.  This
   makes the registration capsules from this document unambiguous.  For
   example, if a client receives a COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule with an
   even Context ID, that has to be an echo of a capsule that the client
   initially sent, indicating that the proxy accepted the registration.
   Since the value 0 was reserved by unextended connect-udp, the Context
   ID value of COMPRESSION_ASSIGN can never be zero.

   Endpoints MUST NOT send two COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsules with the same
   Context ID.  If a recipient detects a repeated Context ID, it MUST
   treat the capsule as malformed.  Receipt of a malformed capsule MUST
   be treated as an error processing the Capsule Protocol, as defined in
   Section 3.3 of [HTTP-DGRAM].

   Endpoints MAY pre-emptively use Context IDs not yet acknowledged by
   the peer via COMPRESSION_ACK, knowing that those HTTP Datagrams can
   be dropped if they arrive before the corresponding
   IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule, or if the
   peer rejects the registration.

2.2.  IP_COMPRESSION_ACK capsule

   The IP Compression Acknowledgment capsule (capsule type TBD) confirms
   registration of a context ID that was received in an
   IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule.

   IP_COMPRESSION_ACK Capsule {
     Type (i) = TBD,
     Length (i),
     Context ID (i),
   }

           Figure 5: IP Compression Acknowledgment Capsule Format

   An endpoint can only send a COMPRESSION_ACK capsule if it received a
   IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule with the
   same Context ID.  If an endpoint receives COMPRESSION_ACK capsule for
   a context ID it did not attempt to register in an
   IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule, that
   capsule is considered malformed.

2.3.  IP_COMPRESSION_CLOSE capsule

   The IP Compression Close capsule (capsule type TDB) serves two
   purposes.  It can be sent as a direct response to a received
   IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule capsule, to
   indicate that the registration was rejected.  It can also be sent
   later to indicate the closure of a previously assigned registration.

   IP_COMPRESSION_CLOSE Capsule {
     Type (i) = TBD,
     Length (i),
     Context ID (i),
   }

               Figure 6: IP Compression Close Capsule Format

   Once an endpoint has either sent or received a IP_COMPRESSION_CLOSE
   for a given Context ID, it MUST NOT send any further datagrams with
   that Context ID.  Since the value 0 was reserved by unextended
   connect-udp, the Context ID value of IP_COMPRESSION_CLOSE can never
   be zero.
