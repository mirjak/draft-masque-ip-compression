1.  Introduction

   This document specifies an extension for IP header compression when
   using Connect-IP [CONNECT-IP] proxying.  It specifies a way to
   provides static information for IP header fields that are then left
   out when using the indicated a context ID.

   This document defines four new capsules to assign new context IDs and
   provide static information in IPv4 and IPv6 headers, acknowlegde the
   use of such a context ID, or cancel its use.  The capsules MUST only
   be used with Connect-IP [CONNECT-IP].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.1.  IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN and IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsules

   The IPv4 Compression Assign capsule (capsule type TBD) is used to
   register a Context ID and provides static values of the IP header
   fields that will be removed from the HTTP Datagram Payload when using
   this Conext ID.  It has the following format:

   IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN Capsule {
     Type (i) = TBD,
     Length (i),
     Context ID (i),
     IHL (1),
     DSCP (1),
     ECN (1),
     ID (1),
     Total Length (1),
     Reserved (1),
     DF (1),
     MF (1),
     Fragment Offset (1),
     TTL (1),
     Protocol (1),
     Checksum (1),
     Source Address (1),
     Destination Address (1),
     Source Port (1),
     Destination Port (1),
     IPv4 Header (20),
     [Transport Ports (16)]
   }

              Figure 1: IPv4 Compression Assign Capsule Format

   It contains the following fields:

   IHL:  This flag indicates if the Internet Header Length field of the
      IP header is static.

   DHCP:  This flag indicates if the DiffServ Code Point field of the IP
      header is static.

   ECN:  This flag indicates if the ECN codepoint field of the IP header
      is static.

   Total Length:  This flag indicates if the Total length field of the
      IP header is static.

   ID:  This flag indicates if the Identification field of the IP header
      is static.

   Reserved:  This flag indicates if the Reserved flag of the IP header
      is static.

   DF:  This flag indicates if the Don't Fragment flag of the IP header
      is static.

   MF:  This flag indicates if the More Fragments flag of the IP header
      is static.

   Fragment Offset:  This flag indicates if the Fragment Offset field of
      the IP header is static.

   TTL:  This flag indicates if the TTL field of the IP header is
      static.

   Protocol:  This flag indicates if the Protocol field of the IP header
      is static.

   Checksum:  This flag indicates if the Checksum field of the IP header
      is static.

   Source Address:  This flag indicates if the IP Source Address of the
      IP header is static.

   Destination Address:  This flag indicates if the IP Destination
      Address of the IP header is static.

   Source Port:  This flag indicates if the Source Port of the header
      that follows the IP header is static.

   Destination Port:  This flag indicates if the Destination Port of the
      header that follows the IP header is static.

   IPv4 Header:  This field contains the first 20 bytes of the IPv4
      header.  Fields that are not indicated as static will be omitted
      in the compression and therefore their value is not relevant.

   Transport Ports:  If either the Source Port or Destination Port Flag
      is set, this field has to be present and contains one byte for the
      source port followed by one byte for the destionation port.

   IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN Capsule {
     Type (i) = TBD,
     Length (i),
     Context ID (i),
     Traffic class (1),
     Flow label (1),
     Payload Length (1),
     Next header (1),
     Hop limit (1),
     Source Address (1),
     Destination Address (1),
     Source Port (1),
     Destination Port (1),
     IPv6 Header (40),
     [Transport Ports (16)]
   }

              Figure 2: IPv6 Compression Assign Capsule Format

   It contains the following fields:

   Traffic Class:  This flag indicates if the Traffic Class field of the
      IP header is static.

   Flow Label:  This flag indicates if the Flow Label field of the IP
      header is static.

   Payload Length:  This flag indicates if the Payload length field of
      the IP header is static.

   Next Header:  This flag indicates if the value of the Next Header
      field of the IP header is static.

   Hop Limit:  This flag indicates if the Hop Limit field of the IP
      header is static.

   Source Address:  This flag indicates if the IP Source Address of the
      IP header is static.

   Destination Address:  This flag indicates if the IP Destination
      Address of the IP header is static.

   Source Port:  This flag indicates if the Source Port of the header
      that follows the IP header is static.

   Destination Port:  This flag indicates if the Destination Port of the
      header that follows the IP header is static.

   IPv6 Header:  This field contains the first 40 bytes of the IPv6
      header.  Fields that are not indicated as static will be omitted
      in the compression and therefore their value is not relevant.

   Transport Ports:  If either the Source Port or Destination Port Flag
      is set, this field has to be present and contains one byte for the
      source port followed by one byte for the destionation port.

   When the indicated Context ID is used all IP header fields that
   indicated as static as well as the version field MUST be omitted in
   the HTTP datagram payload and the receiver of the datagram with the
   indicated Context ID MUST reconstruct the IP header accordingly
   before forwarding the payload.

   When an endpoint receives a IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or
   IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule, it MUST either accept or reject the
   corresponding registration:

   *  if it accepts the registration, the receiver MUST return a
      COMPRESSION_ACK capsule with the Context ID set to the one from
      the received IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN
      capsule back to its peer

   *  if it rejects the registration, the receiver MUST respond by
      sending a COMPRESSION_CLOSE capsule with the Context ID set to the
      one from the received IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or
      IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule.

   As mandated in Section 4 of [CONNECT-UDP], clients can only allocate
   even Context IDs, while proxies can only allocate odd ones.  This
   makes the registration capsules from this document unambiguous.  For
   example, if a client receives a COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule with an
   even Context ID, that has to be an echo of a capsule that the client
   initially sent, indicating that the proxy accepted the registration.
   Since the value 0 was reserved by unextended connect-udp, the Context
   ID value of COMPRESSION_ASSIGN can never be zero.

   Endpoints MUST NOT send two COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsules with the same
   Context ID.  If a recipient detects a repeated Context ID, it MUST
   treat the capsule as malformed.  Receipt of a malformed capsule MUST
   be treated as an error processing the Capsule Protocol, as defined in
   Section 3.3 of [HTTP-DGRAM].

   Endpoints MAY pre-emptively use Context IDs not yet acknowledged by
   the peer via COMPRESSION_ACK, knowing that those HTTP Datagrams can
   be dropped if they arrive before the corresponding
   IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule, or if the
   peer rejects the registration.

2.2.  IP_COMPRESSION_ACK capsule

   The IP Compression Acknowledgment capsule (capsule type TBD) confirms
   registration of a context ID that was received in an
   IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule.

   IP_COMPRESSION_ACK Capsule {
     Type (i) = TBD,
     Length (i),
     Context ID (i),
   }

           Figure 3: IP Compression Acknowledgment Capsule Format

   An endpoint can only send a COMPRESSION_ACK capsule if it received a
   IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule with the
   same Context ID.  If an endpoint receives COMPRESSION_ACK capsule for
   a context ID it did not attempt to register in an
   IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule, that
   capsule is considered malformed.

2.3.  IP_COMPRESSION_CLOSE capsule

   The IP Compression Close capsule (capsule type TDB) serves two
   purposes.  It can be sent as a direct response to a received
   IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule capsule, to
   indicate that the registration was rejected.  It can also be sent
   later to indicate the closure of a previously assigned registration.

   IP_COMPRESSION_CLOSE Capsule {
     Type (i) = TBD,
     Length (i),
     Context ID (i),
   }

               Figure 4: IP Compression Close Capsule Format

   Once an endpoint has either sent or received a IP_COMPRESSION_CLOSE
   for a given Context ID, it MUST NOT send any further datagrams with
   that Context ID.  Since the value 0 was reserved by unextended
   connect-udp, the Context ID value of IP_COMPRESSION_CLOSE can never
   be zero.
