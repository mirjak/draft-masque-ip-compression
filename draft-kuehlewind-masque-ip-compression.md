# Introduction

This document specifies an extension for IP header compression when using Connect-IP
{{!CONNECT-IP=RFC9484}} proxying.
It specifies a way to indicate which IP header fields can be omitted
and provides reference values that are then used to reconstruct omitted fields when using the indicated context ID.

This document defines four new capsules to assign new context IDs and provide static information
in IPv4 and IPv6 headers, acknowlegde the use of such a context ID, or cancel its use.
The capsules MUST only be used with Connect-IP {{CONNECT-IP}}.

# Conventions and Definitions

## IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN and IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsules {#capsule-assign}

The IPv4 Compression Assign capsule (capsule type TBD) is used to register a
Context ID and provides reference values of the IP header fields that will be omitted from the
HTTP Datagram Payload when using this Context ID. It has the following format:

~~~
IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN Capsule {
  Type (i) = TBD,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
  IPv4 Flags (16),
  IPv4 Header (20)
}
~~~
{: #fig-capsule-ipv4-assign title="IPv4 Compression Assign Capsule Format"}

It contains the following fields:

IPv4 Flags:
: A 16-bit field containing flags that indicate which byte-aligned IP header fields can be omitted.
  The format is defined in {{fig-ipv4-flags}}.

IPv4 Header:
: This field contains the first 20 bytes of the IPv4 header. Fields that are not indicated as omitted will be
  included in the compressed packet and therefore their reference value is not relevant.

The IPv4 Flags field has the following format:

~~~
IPv4 Flags {
  Version-IHL (1),
  DSCP-ECN (1),
  Total Length (1),
  Identification (1),
  Flags-FragOffset (1),
  TTL (1),
  Protocol (1),
  Checksum (1),
  Source Address (1),
  Destination Address (1),
  Reserved (6),
}
~~~
{: #fig-ipv4-flags title="IPv4 Flags Format"}

The flags have the following meanings:

Version-IHL:
: This flag indicates if byte 0 of the IPv4 header (Version and IHL fields) can be omitted.

DSCP-ECN:
: This flag indicates if byte 1 of the IPv4 header (DSCP and ECN fields) can be omitted.

Total Length:
: This flag indicates if bytes 2-3 of the IPv4 header (Total Length field) can be omitted (receiver will compute from payload size).

Identification:
: This flag indicates if bytes 4-5 of the IPv4 header (Identification field) can be omitted.

Flags-FragOffset:
: This flag indicates if bytes 6-7 of the IPv4 header (Flags and Fragment Offset fields) can be omitted.

TTL:
: This flag indicates if byte 8 of the IPv4 header (TTL field) can be omitted.

Protocol:
: This flag indicates if byte 9 of the IPv4 header (Protocol field) can be omitted.

Checksum:
: This flag indicates if bytes 10-11 of the IPv4 header (Header Checksum field) can be omitted (receiver will recompute).

Source Address:
: This flag indicates if bytes 12-15 of the IPv4 header (Source Address field) can be omitted.

Destination Address:
: This flag indicates if bytes 16-19 of the IPv4 header (Destination Address field) can be omitted.

Reserved:
: These bits are reserved for future use and MUST be set to zero.

~~~
IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN Capsule {
  Type (i) = TBD,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
  IPv6 Flags (16),
  IPv6 Header (40)
}
~~~
{: #fig-capsule-ipv6-assign title="IPv6 Compression Assign Capsule Format"}

It contains the following fields:

IPv6 Flags:
: A 16-bit field containing flags that indicate which byte-aligned IP header fields can be omitted.
  The format is defined in {{fig-ipv6-flags}}.

IPv6 Header:
: This field contains the first 40 bytes of the IPv6 header. Fields that are not indicated as omitted will be
  included in the compressed packet and therefore their reference value is not relevant.

The IPv6 Flags field has the following format:

~~~
IPv6 Flags {
  Version-FL (1),
  Traffic Class (1),
  Payload Length (1),
  Next Header (1),
  Hop Limit (1),
  Source Address (1),
  Destination Address (1),
  Reserved (9),
}
~~~
{: #fig-ipv6-flags title="IPv6 Flags Format"}

The flags have the following meanings:

Version-FL:
: This flag indicates if the Version field (upper 4 bits of byte 0) and Flow Label field (lower 4 bits of byte 1, and all of bytes 2-3) can be omitted.
  When this flag is set but the Traffic Class flag is not set, the Traffic Class field (lower 4 bits of byte 0 and upper 4 bits of byte 1) MUST be preserved
  as a single byte in the compressed packet.

Traffic Class:
: This flag indicates if the Traffic Class field (lower 4 bits of byte 0 and upper 4 bits of byte 1) can be omitted.
  This flag can be set independently of the Version-FL flag to allow omitting Version and Flow Label while preserving Traffic Class.

Payload Length:
: This flag indicates if bytes 4-5 of the IPv6 header (Payload Length field) can be omitted (receiver will compute from payload size).

Next Header:
: This flag indicates if byte 6 of the IPv6 header (Next Header field) can be omitted.

Hop Limit:
: This flag indicates if byte 7 of the IPv6 header (Hop Limit field) can be omitted.

Source Address:
: This flag indicates if bytes 8-23 of the IPv6 header (Source Address field) can be omitted.

Destination Address:
: This flag indicates if bytes 24-39 of the IPv6 header (Destination Address field) can be omitted.

Reserved:
: These bits are reserved for future use and MUST be set to zero.

When the indicated Context ID is used, all IP header fields that are flagged as omitted
as well as the version field MUST be omitted from the HTTP datagram payload. The receiver of the
datagram with the indicated Context ID MUST reconstruct the complete IP header using the reference
values from the COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule and/or by computing derived values (such as checksums
and length fields) before forwarding the payload.

When an endpoint receives a IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN
capsule, it MUST either accept or reject the corresponding registration:

* if it accepts the registration, the receiver MUST return a COMPRESSION_ACK
  capsule with the Context ID set to the one from the received
  IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule back to its peer

* if it rejects the registration, the receiver MUST respond by sending a
  COMPRESSION_CLOSE capsule with the Context ID set to the one from the
  received IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule.

As mandated in {{Section 4 of !CONNECT-UDP=RFC9298}}, clients can only allocate even
Context IDs, while proxies can only allocate odd ones. This makes the
registration capsules from this document unambiguous. For example, if a
client receives a COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule with an even Context ID, that
has to be an echo of a capsule that the client initially sent, indicating
that the proxy accepted the registration. Since the value 0 was reserved by
unextended connect-udp, the Context ID value of COMPRESSION_ASSIGN can never
be zero.

Endpoints MUST NOT send two COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsules with the same
Context ID. If a recipient detects a repeated Context ID, it MUST treat the
capsule as malformed. Receipt of a malformed capsule MUST be treated as an
error processing the Capsule Protocol, as defined in {{Section 3.3 of
!HTTP-DGRAM=RFC9297}}.

Endpoints MAY pre-emptively use Context IDs not yet acknowledged by the peer
via COMPRESSION_ACK, knowing that those HTTP Datagrams can be dropped if
they arrive before the corresponding IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule,
or if the peer rejects the registration.

## IP_COMPRESSION_ACK capsule {#capsule-ack}

The IP Compression Acknowledgment capsule (capsule type TBD) confirms
registration of a context ID that was received in an IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN
or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule.

~~~
IP_COMPRESSION_ACK Capsule {
  Type (i) = TBD,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #fig-capsule-ack title="IP Compression Acknowledgment Capsule Format"}

An endpoint can only send a COMPRESSION_ACK capsule if it received a
IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule with the same Context ID.
If an endpoint receives COMPRESSION_ACK capsule for a context ID it did not attempt
to register in an IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule, that
capsule is considered malformed.

## IP_COMPRESSION_CLOSE capsule {#capsule-close}

The IP Compression Close capsule (capsule type TDB) serves two purposes. It
can be sent as a direct response to a received IP4_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN or
IP6_COMPRESSION_ASSIGN capsule capsule, to indicate that the registration
was rejected. It can also be sent later to indicate the closure of a
previously assigned registration.

~~~
IP_COMPRESSION_CLOSE Capsule {
  Type (i) = TBD,
  Length (i),
  Context ID (i),
}
~~~
{: #fig-capsule-close title="IP Compression Close Capsule Format"}

Once an endpoint has either sent or received a IP_COMPRESSION_CLOSE for a given
Context ID, it MUST NOT send any further datagrams with that Context ID.
Since the value 0 was reserved by unextended connect-udp, the Context ID
value of IP_COMPRESSION_CLOSE can never be zero.
